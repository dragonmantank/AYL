# Are You Listening

Are You Listening (AYL) is a platform for creating presentations that have 
questions and answers afterwards. It makes it very easy to push out training
and record how well people are doing.

## Concept

Many times companies and organizations want to push out training to users, but
also allow the users to take these training sessions at their own convience. 
AYL allows these training presentations to be created online and then distributed
via the internet. Tests follow the presentations, and the results are recorded
for trainers to keep track.
